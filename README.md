# Helix Plugin Repository

## Loot Containers Plugin

This plugin will spawn a list of items inside a container for players to find and loot.

* The spawns are set using the command `/LootAddSpawn <path model>`.
* The spawns are removed using the command `/LootRemoveSpawn <number distance>`.
* The spawns are displayed for 15 seconds using the command `/LootDisplaySpawn`.

You can add new item rarities and item categories in sh_categoriesrarities.lua and new container models in sh_models.lua.

All other configurations can be done inside Helix.

## Combine Chatter

It allows the combine to hear radio chatter at random intervals.
New chatter can be added in sv_plugin.lua

Intervals can be configured in Helix.
